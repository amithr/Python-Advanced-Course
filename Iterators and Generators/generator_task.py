# Imagine you have 3 employees and it's been agreed that the employees will take it in turns to lock up the shop at night. This means that for employees A, B, and C, employee A will close the shop on day 1, then B will close the shop on day 2, C will close the shop on day 3, and then we start the cycle again with employee A.

# Write a program to create a schedule that lists which of your employees will lock up the shop on a given day over a 30 day period. You should list the day number, the employee name, and the day of the week. You can choose any employee to lock the shop on day 1, 
# and you can also choose which day of the week day 1 corresponds to.
